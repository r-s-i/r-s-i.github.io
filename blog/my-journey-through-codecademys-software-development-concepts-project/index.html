          on Codecademy, one has to do a portfolio/kanban project. The mission
          was to design a pattern-searching algorithm. Since the course didn't
          assume familiarity with any programming language, the final step was
          writing pseudocode. But, since I could, I made a fully functional
          React app.
        </p>

        <h2>The Outline</h2>
        <p>
          The first step was outlining the algorithm. Here is the list I made:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Initialize text variable (from user input)</li>
          <li>Initialize pattern variable (from user input)</li>
          <li>Initialize patternCount variable to 0</li>
          <li>Initialize currentPlace variable to 0</li>
          <li>
            Loop through the text looking for the pattern, do not use RegEx
          </li>
          <li>If the pattern is found notify the user of the quantity</li>
          <li>If the pattern is not found output: "No match"</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Flowchart</h2>
        <p>
          The next step was to make a flowchart, the original was made with
          pencil and paper, but I also made a version digitally:
        </p>

        <img
          src="./flowchart.webp"
          width="2246"
          height="1588"
          alt="Flowchart going through the logic of the algorithm"
        />

        <h2>The Pseudocode</h2>
        <p>
          The final step of the portfolio project was to create pseudocode from
          the flowchart. The following is my attempt to translate it:
        </p>

        <img
          src="pseudocode.webp"
          width="713"
          height="579"
          alt="pseudocode going through the logic of the algorithm"
        />

        <h2>The Code</h2>
        <p>
          To test the algorithm, before I spent time on the user interface, I
          made a Node version. Although there would be some adjustments to make
          with the script, going from Node to React would not present much more
          additional work. With the pseudocode to guide me, I made this:
        </p>
        <img
          src="node-version.webp"
          width="835"
          height="773"
          alt="Node version of the code"
        />
        <p>
          After manually testing that it worked, I called on create-react-app to
          make a React template for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first task was to create a logo/favicon. I made it quickly using
          Gimp, and I converted the finished product using InkScape into an SVG
          file for the logo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I changed the template-given CSS in order to make the
          visuals more to my liking. As a user, my eyes loathe staring at a
          mostly white screen. So, when I'm in charge, I prefer to make a dark
          theme. And that's what I did this time too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Afterward, I moved on to retrofit the script to work in the React
          ecosystem. Maybe not so surprisingly, I needed to use both useState
          and handleChange to make it work inside the App. Since it was such a
          tiny app, I didn't see the need to split the App function into a
          presentational and a container component. If you want to see the code
          in question it is on my

          >
            GitHub page</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          I spent more time than I needed, but that was my choice. I wanted to
          get more familiar with React, and I did (to a small degree). The
          flowchart was quick to draft, and with an eraser, some tape, and
          scissors it was manageable to make edits. However, after making the
          flowchart, the pseudocode was a time-waster, in my case. Granted,
          using this method, I found that I had to make another loop and another
          variable (PATTERN_MATCHES). But that is something I would have
          realized writing the actual code. Why write pseudocode when I could as
          easily (and more proficiently) write the actual code? I can see
          pseudocode being useful if you have to make different versions of the
          program, or if you need to communicate across different programming
          languages.
